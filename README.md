# ReadME for the BIBV Newspaper
## Hi There! 👋
This is the owner (managing) account for the BASIS Independent Bellevue Newspaper, called "On a Monthly BASIS", ran unofficially by Hengsheng Wang on behalf of the school's actual newspaper team. In the future, projects we are considering and planning include:
- Creating a repository for our Github Pages website, where we will post our monthly newsletters. (Finished; contributing is still underway)
- We will also add additional relevant content there, such as audio transcripts, videos of interviews, and puzzles.

## About US 
The BASIS Independent Bellevue Newsletter is a student-led club at BIBV.
- Our Newsletter Title is "On a MONTHLY BASIS" (the pun is very fun, right?)
- We publish a meticulously written and designed newsletter every month with updates on all sorts of interesting events happening in our intellectual society.

## Site Planning 💻
- The site will be hosted on Github Pages with a main URL of `bibvnewspaper.github.io`
- A home page dedicated as an introduction to who we are
- There will be subpages such as "About Us" and "Archives", and in the (not too distant) future, we will add pages for every article
- It is planned that we will upload the PDF of the newspaper every time in a clear format.

## Contributor Lists + Collaboration 🤩
- Further edits may be determined in the future; currently planned as:
  - Hengsheng (`conquerer-of-tourist`) contributing from his personal account.
  - Main merges can be made on this account.
  - Maybe I can get some other people to help out with LOGISTICS
  - Link @ `bibvnewspaper.github.io`

## Outlines for the style of the pages 🖌️
- After doing much research online with ChatGPT, as well as asking people who made nice organization websites, including
  - members of the Competitive Programming Initiative (the people who wrote the USACO Guide)
  - Andrew Chen (writer of `wamomath.org`)

It is appealing to..
- Use a nice theme with Inter and minimalistic overall design
- One thing I noticed is that it is important to incorporate thin lines for rounded corners but for the aesthetics,
  - Retain a fixed rounding for corners
  - Add regular rectangles as well
 
Some givens for the website design.. probably the use of MDX and Tailwind CSS for its nice looks.
