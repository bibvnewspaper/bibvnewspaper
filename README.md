# ReadME for the BIBV Newspaper
## Hi There! 👋
Hengsheng (me) current runs this account for the BASIS Independent Bellevue Newspaper, called "On a Monthly BASIS".
- Creating a repository for our Github Pages website, where we will post our monthly newsletters.
- We will also add additional relevant content there, such as audio transcripts, videos of interviews, and puzzles.

## About US 
The BASIS Independent Bellevue Newsletter is a student-led club at BIBV.
- Our Newsletter Title is "On a MONTHLY BASIS" (the pun is very fun, right?)
- We publish a meticulously written and designed newsletter every month with updates on all sorts of interesting events happening in our intellectual society.

## Site Planning 💻
- The site will be hosted on Github Pages with a main URL of `bibvnewspaper.github.io`
- A home page dedicated as an introduction to who we are
- There will be subpages such as "About Us" and "Archives", and in the (not too distant) future, we will add pages for every article
- It is planned that we will upload the PDF of the newspaper every time in a clear format.

## Contributor Lists + Collaboration 🤩
- Further edits may be determined in the future; currently planned as:
  - Hengsheng (`conquerer-of-tourist`) contributing from his personal account.
  - Main merges can be made on this account.
  - Maybe I can get some other people to help out with LOGISTICS
  - Link @ `bibvnewspaper.github.io`

## Outlines for the style of the pages 🖌️
- Implementation of NextJS with help of Astro
- Main content is shown with MDX.
