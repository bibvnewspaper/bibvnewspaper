## ReadME for the BIBV Newspaper

This account is currently ran unofficially by Hengsheng Wang on behalf of the BASIS Independent Bellevue's newspaper team. In the future, we are planning on
- Creating a repository for our Github Pages website, where we will post our monthly newsletters.
- We will also add additional relevant content there, such as audio transcripts and videos of interviews, etc.

## About US

The BASIS Independent Bellevue Newsletter is a club at BIBV.
- Our Newsletter Title is "On a MONTHLY BASIS" (the pun is very fun, right?)
- We publish a new newsletter every month

## Site Planning
- Probably organize a Codespace or organization or something, but that costs money
- Currently trying to figure out logistics for contributing, etc.

## Contributor List
- Further edits may be determined in the future; currently planned as:
  - Hengsheng (conquerer-of-tourist) contributing from personal account.
  - Main merges can be made on this account.
  - Maybe I can get some other people to help out with LOGISTICS
  - Link @ `bibvnewspaper.github.io`
