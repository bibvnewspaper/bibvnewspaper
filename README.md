# ReadME for the BIBV Newspaper

This account is currently ran unofficially by Hengsheng Wang on behalf of the BASIS Independent Bellevue's newspaper team. In the future, we are planning on
- Creating a repository for our Github Pages website, where we will post our monthly newsletters.
- We will also add additional relevant content there, such as audio transcripts and videos of interviews, etc.

## About US

The BASIS Independent Bellevue Newsletter is a club at BIBV.
- Our Newsletter Title is "On a MONTHLY BASIS" (the pun is very fun, right?)
- We publish a new newsletter every month

## Site Planning
- Probably organize a Codespace or organization or something, but that costs money
- Currently trying to figure out logistics for contributing, etc.

## Contributor List
- Further edits may be determined in the future; currently planned as:
  - Hengsheng (conquerer-of-tourist) contributing from personal account.
  - Main merges can be made on this account.
  - Maybe I can get some other people to help out with LOGISTICS
  - Link @ `bibvnewspaper.github.io`

# Outlines for the BIBV Website

Written by Hengsheng Wang (January 27th, 2026)
* Home Page:
  * We can have some sort of header introducing ourselves as the On a Monthly BASIS newspaper
  * Have the latest release right below the header
  * Have some sort of bar at the top for navigation (incorporate some kind of aesthetic design)
* The baseline host could probably be some sort of static thingy.. using a Jekyll template could also make things really easy
* It is important to have an archives page for newspapers for previous years; we should also
  * Incorporate individual article pages
  * Some sort of "Who we are" page
 
For styles, I found a lot of CPI members using cool tools like NextJS; the USACO Guide formatting is also very appealing.
